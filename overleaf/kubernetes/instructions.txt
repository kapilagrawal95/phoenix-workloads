Everything else is fine.
Don;t forget to change in web-deployment line 37
More specifically, real-time is a websocket.
In k8s, it is important to expose the websocket port using a NodePort (already done in real-time-deployment.yaml)

(Look at the stackoverflow answer and its reply to understand better)
Also when a new IP is generated that IP should be replaced in line 37 in web-deployment.
Rest is ok.

Sometimes there is a websocket error when trying to go into the file:. The reason is that the entire deployment was deleted, i.e., had to remove everything (except persistent volumes).
If such a case occurs, reprovision another Cloudlab Cluster and start over.
